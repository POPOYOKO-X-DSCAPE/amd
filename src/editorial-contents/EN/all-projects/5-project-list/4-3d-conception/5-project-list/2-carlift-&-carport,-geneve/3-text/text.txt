This unique 3D concept, created by AMD Interior Designer, embodies a technical and aesthetic feat: a one-of-a-kind system of four car lifts integrated beneath a cobblestone courtyard. Entirely concealed, these platforms can accommodate up to eight vehicles without disrupting the harmony of the space. A rare balance between functional innovation and respect for the surrounding landscape. Here, architecture becomes silent—yet remarkable.

Facing Lake Geneva, this contemporary residence in Cologny was entirely redesigned by AMD Interior Designer. Ultra-modern and tailor-made, it reflects a shared vision with its owners, down to the unique pool design. Smart systems, rare technical features and light mapping reveal the engineering behind the architecture. A monumental aquarium, both artwork and structure, defines the scale of this singular project.

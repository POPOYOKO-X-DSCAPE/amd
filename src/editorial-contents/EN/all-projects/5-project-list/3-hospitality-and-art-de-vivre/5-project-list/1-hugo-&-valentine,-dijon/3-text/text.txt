AMD Interior Designer unveils a new “Art de Vivre” project for the gourmet shop Hugo & Valentine in Dijon.
The studio designed a warm and elegant boutique where authenticity meets modernity.
On one side, a backlit wine and spirits display highlights the finest bottles; on the other, two refrigerated showcases present fresh local products.
The project also includes the renovation of a dining area and the refurbishment of an inner courtyard transformed into a convivial summer space for guests.

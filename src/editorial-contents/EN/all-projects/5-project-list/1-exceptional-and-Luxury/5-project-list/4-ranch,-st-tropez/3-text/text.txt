A rare 60-hectare estate spanning Saint-Tropez and Ramatuelle. Two restored buildings and a secured construction permit pave the way for a new high-end hamlet.
Nestled in preserved nature, this ongoing project reflects AMD’s exclusive vision of refined living in the heart of the Gulf of Saint-Tropez.

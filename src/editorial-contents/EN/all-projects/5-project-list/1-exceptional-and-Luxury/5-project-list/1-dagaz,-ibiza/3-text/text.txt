Located on the front line of the Mediterranean, this exceptional 1,200 m² villa (under development) stands as a true architectural feat in Ibiza. With private access to a wild cove, it combines absolute luxury, cutting-edge technology, and natural integration within a preserved environment.
Designed as a fluid architectural journey between indoors and outdoors, the villa is organized around a spectacular 400 m² living area, fully open to the outside and conceived to enhance light, perspectives, and volumes. The project stands out for its suspended gardens—true green interludes—woven into a resolutely contemporary structure.
The entire property is equipped with ultra-premium features and a world-unique home automation system, offering an infinite range of personalized lighting scenarios for a tailor-made sensory experience at any moment of the day.
The highlight of the property: a 300 m² swimming pool, extending the horizon line and merging architecture, landscape, and sea.

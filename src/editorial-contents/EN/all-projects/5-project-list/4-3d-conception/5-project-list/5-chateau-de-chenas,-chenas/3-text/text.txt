This castle embodies the meeting of heritage and contemporary design.
Nothing was left to chance by the 3D design teams at AMD Interior Designer :
The old materials were restored and enhanced.
Each space was designed to combine aesthetics and comfort: a cosy boudoir, elegant bedrooms, living rooms redesigned around refined interior architecture, and a cinema space designed to be an immersive experience.
The spa extends this quest for balance with a relaxation area where natural materials are expressed with sobriety and elegance. Finally, the large dining room celebrates conviviality, set off by sculptural lighting.
A harmonious vision of a historic place reinvented with rigour and balance.

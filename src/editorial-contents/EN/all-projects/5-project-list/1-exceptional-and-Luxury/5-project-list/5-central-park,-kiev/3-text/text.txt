This exceptional apartment, perched on the 26th floor with sweeping views of Kyiv, was conceived in a distinctly contemporary spirit through close collaboration between the architect and the owner. A hallmark of the project is the meticulous personalization of every detail—from the spatial layout and choice of materials to the creation of bespoke furniture and unique decorative elements.

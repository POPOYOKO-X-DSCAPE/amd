In the heart of one of the most prestigious Swiss Alpine domains, in Verbier, this 1,500 m² achievement combines refinement and technical mastery.
It began with the rehabilitation of an existing chalet, followed by the bespoke construction of a second.
The bold creation of an underground entrance carved into the rock opens onto a spacious parking area, allowing passage from one chalet to the other.
This project was awarded the Architecture & Design Award in 2017.

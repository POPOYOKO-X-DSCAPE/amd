This Guest House in Geneva embodies a contemporary and refined approach to private hospitality. Clean volumes meet noble materials: green marble, ribbed wood, textured glass, and bronze finishes. The spaces include suites with bathrooms, lounge, office, dressing room, and wellness areas. Every detail was modeled in 3D, reflecting the bespoke signature of AMD Interior Designer.

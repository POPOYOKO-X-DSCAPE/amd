The project consists of creating a sculptural screen designed to visually separate the living room and dining room without partitioning the space. Inspired by the natural shapes of coral, it plays on a balance between solids and voids to filter light and offer a presence that is both airy and structuring.
At the crossroads of object design and artistic installation, this screen becomes a central element of the décor, both functional and poetic.
